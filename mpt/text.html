<h1> MINIMUM VARIANCE PORTFOLIO </h1>
<p> More that 60 years ago, economist Harry Markowitz showed the world a framework to manage the relation between risk and return in portfolios. Today, his insights are largly being used among the industry and therefore deserve our attention.</p>
<p> The following analysis was ran using Python and by following <a href="https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/markowitz-portfolio-optimization/">this amazing post</a> written by Dr. Thomas Starke, David Edwards and Dr. Thomas Wiecki.</p>


<h2> Goal </h2>
<p> The aim is to definie the Global Minimum Variance porfolio by using 4 simulated stocks returns. </p>
This is done in four steps:
<ol> 1) Simulate returns for 4 stocks.</ol>
<ol> 2) Generate 1000 random portfolios with simulated data. </ol>
<ol> 3) Define the upper part of the efficient frontier.</ol>
<ol> 4) Visualize portfolio's performance </ol>


<h2> Step 1: Simulating Data </h2>
<p> This first image shows the returns for one of the simulated stocks. It was generated with a normal distribution with mean zero, since MPT modeles required that investor's utility is cuadratic or that the join distribution of returns is normal.</p>

<p> We will assume this in orther to proceed, but this assuptions are hard to belive. Evidence suggests that returns tend to present a leptokurtic and negative skewed distribution and that investors increase their positions in risky assets while they get healthier.</p>


<h2> Step 2: Generating Random Portfolios </h2>
